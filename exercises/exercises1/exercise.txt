Task: Implementing a Documents Management System with Prototype-Clones.

You will be working on a document management system that will manage various types of documents, including reports, contracts and presentations.
To increase efficiency, a prototype design pattern is to be implemented so that new documents can be created by cloning existing templates (Objects).


1.  Implement an abstract class `Document` that contains an abstract method `clone()`.
    Implement a suitable constructor.
    The document type 'type' is to be specified in the 'Document'. Implement getters and setters for this.

2.  Create the classes 'Report', 'Presentation' and 'Contract'. These classes inherit from 'Document'.
    Implement constructors in the classes.
    The public arguments 'title', 'content' and 'author' should be instantiated in each classes.

3.  Create a main() function. Create template objects for the classes 'Report', 'Presentation' and 'Contract', instantiate the arguments. Set on each Object the Document Type.
    Output the arguments and document types in the terminal

4.  Create a new object with a template object. Change the arguments and the document type and create an output again.
